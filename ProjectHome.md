From the README:

### OVERVIEW ###

---


This directory contains a C++ software toolkit built at NIST for
programming with ISO 14649 Parts 10, 11, and 111. Those parts are a
data model to be used for control of a machining center. Those
Parts are fully covered.

The toolkit supports both (1) direct access to C++ class data and
(2) indirect access. Indirect access is provided by making class
data private and having public get and set functions for each data
item. Direct access is provided by making class data public so that
no get or set functions are needed. The names of files using direct
access include "Direct".

The toolkit contains four principal items (plus utilities).

  1. C++ class definitions and implementations.
  1. A parser for STEP Part 21 files.
  1. A simple stand-alone parser/printer.
  1. An ISO 14649 interpreter for 3-axis machining.

The software is all in standard C++, so it may be compiled and run on any computer for which a standard C++ compiler is available.
